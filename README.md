1. CHAP. III. But now to descend a little further, nearer unto our own age, to speak somthing to them, which I believe look upon themselves, to be Catholick and Apostolick in Doctrine and practice according to the Primitive time and order, and that they are totally come out of the Apostacy.

1. CHAP. IIII. Now a few words to shew unto all, how they may come out of the Apostacy, to be members of the true Church, which is in God, the Lambs wife.

1. CHAP. XVI. Something concerning the worship of God, whether that Kings and Rulers now in Gospel times have any power from God to compel or force about Spiritual things declared, and some Scriptures answered which hath been perverted by them who are in the Apostacy, to maintain the Beasts power, and the false Churches worship under the raign of Antichrist.

1. CHAP. XVII. Concerning Oaths in the first Covenant and the Lawfulness thereof, and the unlawfulness thereof discovered in the New Covenant, in Gospel times; Though Apostates mingle the Ordinances of both together, denying all oaths proved to be no new Doctrine.

1. CHAP. XVIII. Tythes in their first institution unto whom they were due according to the Command of God declared; and that Tythes are no way lawful to be received, neither sought for by any who are Ministers of the new Covenant and the everlasting Gospel, proved out of the Scripture and Antiquity.

1. CHAP. XIX. Respecting of persons and Complemental bowings and worshipping one another, and flattering titles no good manners, but are in the transgression, and hath been antiently reproved and condemned.

1. CHAP. XX. Universities and Schools of Natural Learning are of no use, as to the making of Ministers of Christ in the Primitive times, but a thing introduced, & brought in in latter ages by the Apogates who had erred from the Spirit, who then admired and set up natural Languages and Philosophy, that thereby they might be furnished to make discourses, speeches and Sermons to get money by, and as they are holden up at this day, are made an absolute Idol; and as to their Practise its generally known to be prophane, and no way meet to advance the Church of Christ.
